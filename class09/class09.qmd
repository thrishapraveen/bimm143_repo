Reading in the CSV and looking at it closer:
```{r}
pdb_stats <- read.csv("/Users/thrishapraveen/Downloads/BIMM143/class09/Data Export Summary.csv")
pdb_stats
str(pdb_stats)


```


>Q1: What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy.
sum(X.ray)+sum(EM) = 191,374+24,836 = 216,210 / total = 216,210/231,029= 0.9359 = 93.59%

>Q2: What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein?
If we're looking at protein(only), then it's 199,236/231,029=0.862
If we're looking at all the protein columns, then it's (199,236+12,822+14,156)/231,029 = 0.979

>Q3: Type HIV in the PDB website search box on the home page and determine how many HIV-1 protease structures are in the current PDB?
231,029 HIV-1 protease structures

2. Visualizing the HIV-1 protease structure

>Q4: Water molecules normally have 3 atoms. Why do we see just one atom per water molecule in this structure?
In PDB files, hydrogen atoms aren't explicitly stored. Thus, for water molecules, only the oxygen atom is stores/visualized.

>Q5: There is a critical “conserved” water molecule in the binding site. Can you identify this water molecule? What residue number does this water molecule have?
I didn't understand how to tell what is a conserved water molecule, but the one that seems to play a role in the binding site is HOH 308. 

>Q6: Generate and save a figure clearly showing the two distinct chains of HIV-protease along with the ligand. You might also consider showing the catalytic residues ASP 25 in each chain and the critical water (we recommend “Ball & Stick” for these side-chains). Add this figure to your Quarto document.

3. Introduction to Bio3D in R

```{r}
library(bio3d)
pdb <- read.pdb("1hsg")
pdb

```
>Q7: How many amino acid residues are there in this pdb object? 
198

>Q8: Name one of the two non-protein residues? 
HOH

>Q9: How many protein chains are in this structure? 
2

```{r}
attributes(pdb)
head(pdb$atom)

```

Predicting functional motions of a single structure

```{r}
adk <- read.pdb("6s36")
adk
```

```{r}
# Perform flexiblity prediction
m <- nma(adk)
plot(m)
```

```{r}
mktrj(m, file="adk_m7.pdb")

```

4. Comparative structure analysis of Adenylate Kinase
>Q10. Which of the packages above is found only on BioConductor and not CRAN? 
msa

>Q11. Which of the above packages is not found on BioConductor or CRAN?: 
bio3d-view

>Q12. True or False? Functions from the devtools package can be used to install packages from GitHub and BitBucket? 
TRUE

Search and retrieve ADK structures
```{r}
library(bio3d)
aa <- get.seq("1ake_A")
aa
```

>Q13. How many amino acids are in this sequence, i.e. how long is this sequence? 
214

```{r}
# Blast or hmmer search 
#b <- blast.pdb(aa)
```

```{r}
# Plot a summary of search results
#hits <- plot(b)
```

```{r}
# List out some 'top hits'
#head(hits$pdb.id)
```

```{r}
hits <- NULL
hits$pdb.id <- c('1AKE_A','6S36_A','6RZE_A','3HPR_A','1E4V_A','5EJE_A','1E4Y_A','3X2S_A','6HAP_A','6HAM_A','4K46_A','3GMT_A','4PZL_A')
```

```{r}
# Download releated PDB files
files <- get.pdb(hits$pdb.id, path="pdbs", split=TRUE, gzip=TRUE)
```

Align and superpose structures
```{r}
# Align releated PDBs
pdbs <- pdbaln(files, fit = TRUE, exefile="msa")
```

```{r}
# Vector containing PDB codes for figure axis
ids <- basename.pdb(pdbs$id)

# Draw schematic alignment
#plot(pdbs, labels=ids)
library(knitr)
include_graphics("/Users/thrishapraveen/Downloads/BIMM143/class09/seq_align.png")

```
>My Sequence Alignment looks different than the one on the Class 9 page. Some of the sequences there are missing here.
>This image wasn't letting me render, so I attached a screenshot instead.

Annotate collected PDB structures
```{r}
anno <- pdb.annotate(ids)
unique(anno$source)
```
>## [6] "Vibrio cholerae O1 biovar El Tor str. N16961" is missing and I'm not sure why

```{r}
anno
```

Principal component analysis
```{r}
# Perform PCA
pc.xray <- pca(pdbs)
plot(pc.xray)
```
Figure 9: Results of PCA on Adenylate kinase X-ray structures. Each dot represents one PDB structure.

>The values are a little off compared to the Class 9 page.

```{r}
# Calculate RMSD
rd <- rmsd(pdbs)

# Structure-based clustering
hc.rd <- hclust(dist(rd))
grps.rd <- cutree(hc.rd, k=3)

plot(pc.xray, 1:2, col="grey50", bg=grps.rd, pch=21, cex=1)
